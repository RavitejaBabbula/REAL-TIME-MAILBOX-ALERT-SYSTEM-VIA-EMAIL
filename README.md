# REAL-TIME-MAILBOX-ALERT-SYSTEM-VIA-EMAIL

At first,we take input from colllege web site and then we will  gather total information from the website by inspecting the important news from the college website.

Then we will create respective links for the news for input.

And also we will take students mail IDâ€™s as input.The links that we created are extracted by a separate domain mail.

And we can mention the time for mail alerts from college then students will receive mail alerts at mentioned time.

In our method we use python programming language to implement the code.We have various compilers available but we use wayscript to implement the code.
